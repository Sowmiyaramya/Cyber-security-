 UDP contains=65,535 ports
  total=1,30,070
  The ports are entry gate of a system
  443-https(safe) and 80-http(unsafe)
Differnce between HTTPS and HTTP

career opportunities:
    Offensive (RED TEAM)
    defensive(SOC  analyst) (BLUE TEAM)
    Both offensiveamd defensive=purple team
 types of hackers:
     WHITE hat (complete knowledge about the architecture)
     BLACK hat(without any information/knowledge)
     GREY hat(both  white and black )(dangerous)

     Avaliability
*Confidentiality
     AUthentcation:verfiying one's identity
     There are 3 factor to verify ones aunthentication:
      1.knowledge(something known)
      2. Physical(something you have(adhar card,pan card etc...))
      3. Biometrics(something you are(finger prints etc....))

 LINUX:LS
 WINDOWS:DIR
 LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM RELEASED-*1991*
COMMAND USED FOR OUTPUT-*echo TEXT*
USERNAME LOGGED TO DEPLOYED LINUX MACHINE-*tryhackme*
If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use-*&*
If I wanted to *replace* the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be-*echo password123>passwords*
Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be-*echo tryhackme>>passwords*
*LINUX IS USED IN:*
         CAR,ENTERTAINMENT,REGISTER IN SHOPS,TRAFFIC LIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE
*echo*== Output any text that we provide
*whoami* ==	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
what exists in the first place ==*ls*
DISPLAY THE CURRENT FILE IN LS DIRECTORY == *cd*
CONCATENATION ==*cat*
displays the full pathname of the current directory == *pwd*
a command used for searching specific values in content == *grep*
to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages we will use the command *"GoBuster"*
COMMANDS USED IN WINDOWS==*dir*
cd..\..\ = *FORWARD*
*cd .. * -backward
WHERE PROGRAM IS DOWNLOADED=*where python*
*cd ../../../* =HOW MANY SLASHES THERE IT WILL GO THAT MUCH TIMES BACKWARD
*where*COMMAND IS ONLY USED IN COMMAND PROMPT NOT IN POWERSHELL
*echo "test" > filename== A FILE IS CREATED*
*cat.\filename == test*
*more* command is used to read the file name in command prompt
IF EXTENSION IS NOT THERE THEN IT IS NOT VISIBLE IN WINDOWS
The *mkdir*command in Linux/Unix is a command-line utility that allows users to create new directories
*mv* COMMAND IS USED TO MOVE

mv .\sourcefilename .\destfilename\
*cp* - USED TO COPY THE FILE
DNS is working with port 53
python -m http.server 9999
local host=
ETH0:ethernet 0
LO:loop back
VPN:encryption/decryption
ENcyption:clear text to cipher text
Decrytion "ciper text to clear text
**symmetric encryption:  SINGLE KEY
Asymmetric encryption:** public key and private key
wireshark: packet analayer tool
ip.adrr==163.170.138.35
 3 way handshake:sending SYN packet
 SYN
 SYN-ACK
 ACK  this 3 is called 3 way handshake.
 TLS handshake:TRansport layer security
 Virustotal
 Differnce b/w hashing and encryption
 All possible  permutation and combination is called brute force attack.
 Https is a asymmetric encryption.
 ippacket craft:design the own packet
 THERE are 3 Testing  environment:
   1.[production environment-live websites/ web app
   2.staging environment-Actual copy of production environment
   3.QA environment-test build we can review the code.

Top 10 Web Application Security Risks :
   how it can be dedect anf how to prevent.
   WAF: web application  firwall
    how to dededect sql using single quote and double quote.
directory traversal: nagivate from onr directory to anaother directory.
web shell- browser
bind shell-process combine
reverse shell-user interaction
need for cyber securtiy:
    CHECK PONIT company releases lots of websites
 Types of foot printing:
 Active :directing interact with the target
 passive: trying to collet the information about the target.
 DdOS(Distributed Denial of services): It is designed foe overload a website.
 WSA=secured web appliance
