cyber security:securing data,devices,etc...
Networks: medium to communicate
Hacking:Gaining unaunthorized access
Ethical hacking:Gaining unaunthorized access with written concern
Vulnerability:weakness
cyber security tools:1
    Hashcat :Password hacking tool
    bruteforce technique
    Attacks
    RAT(remote access trojan)
    meta sploit
implementing security:
           1 Physical control   
           2 Administrative control   
           3 logical control
port scanning 
protocol:Set of rules
TCP/UDP =to connect the hardware and software
 TCP contains=65,535 ports
 UDP contains=65,535 ports
  total=1,30,070
  The ports are entry gate of a system
  443-https(safe) and 80-http(unsafe)
Differnce between HTTPS and HTTP
Block chain:
Exploit:
SQL injection:
session Ijacking :
Phishing
DNS 
IP address
cloud
cryptography
spoofing
Hashing
specific hacking =web application penetration testing
web page:
web application:user interaction
web site:
web server:
career opportunities:
    Offensive (RED TEAM)
    defensive(SOC  analyst) (BLUE TEAM)
    Both offensiveamd defensive=purple team
 types of hackers:
     WHITE hat (complete knowledge about the architecture)
     BLACK hat(without any information/knowledge)
     GREY hat(both  white and black )(dangerous)
     hacktivism-hacking for social causes
     script kiddies-using tools without knowledge
     STATE hackers=government pays and make them to hack other state information.
CIA :
     confidentiality
     Integrity(orginality)
     Avaliability
*Confidentiality
     AUthentcation:verfiying one's identity
     There are 3 factor to verify ones aunthentication:
      1.knowledge(something known)
      2. Physical(something you have(adhar card,pan card etc...))
      3. Biometrics(something you are(finger prints etc....))
Authorization(Acess control):permission to access
UAC:user access control
*intergrity
     Safe data transfer -https
     SSL:secured software layer
  encryption:conversion of  clear texts to cipher texts
*Availability:
   firewall
   antivirus
 @echo off 
 start calc
 start mspaint(save as all files)
 CIDR opposite is subnet
 same subnet same ip address is called LAN
 More than one subnet is called WAN.
 -c = swtich
 ipconfig --help
 linux= c switch
 windows=n switch
 ping:A tool to test connectivity
 same types of device to connect:cross over
 differnet types of network to connect:straight through
 For connect 2 router:serial cables or coaxial
 ROUTER :transmit packets from one route to another route 
 NIC:network Interface Card
 HUB:Data will tramist to all packets  
 hub=layer 2
 switch =layer 3
 DHCP:Automatatic aassign the IP address.
 LINUX:LS
 WINDOWS:DIR
 LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM RELEASED-*1991*
COMMAND USED FOR OUTPUT-*echo TEXT*
USERNAME LOGGED TO DEPLOYED LINUX MACHINE-*tryhackme*
If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use-*&*
If I wanted to *replace* the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be-*echo password123>passwords*
Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be-*echo tryhackme>>passwords*
*LINUX IS USED IN:*
         CAR,ENTERTAINMENT,REGISTER IN SHOPS,TRAFFIC LIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE
*echo*== Output any text that we provide
*whoami* ==	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
what exists in the first place ==*ls*
DISPLAY THE CURRENT FILE IN LS DIRECTORY == *cd*
CONCATENATION ==*cat*
displays the full pathname of the current directory == *pwd*
a command used for searching specific values in content == *grep*
to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages we will use the command *"GoBuster"*
COMMANDS USED IN WINDOWS==*dir*
cd..\..\ = *FORWARD*
*cd .. * -backward
WHERE PROGRAM IS DOWNLOADED=*where python*
*cd ../../../* =HOW MANY SLASHES THERE IT WILL GO THAT MUCH TIMES BACKWARD
*where*COMMAND IS ONLY USED IN COMMAND PROMPT NOT IN POWERSHELL
*echo "test" > filename== A FILE IS CREATED*
*cat.\filename == test*
*more* command is used to read the file name in command prompt
IF EXTENSION IS NOT THERE THEN IT IS NOT VISIBLE IN WINDOWS
The *mkdir*command in Linux/Unix is a command-line utility that allows users to create new directories
*mv* COMMAND IS USED TO MOVE

mv .\sourcefilename .\destfilename\
*cp* - USED TO COPY THE FILE
DNS is working with port 53
python -m http.server 9999
local host=
ETH0:ethernet 0
LO:loop back
VPN:encryption/decryption
ENcyption:clear text to cipher text
Decrytion "ciper text to clear text
**symmetric encryption:  SINGLE KEY
Asymmetric encryption:** public key and private key
wireshark: packet analayer tool
ip.adrr==163.170.138.35
 3 way handshake:sending SYN packet
 SYN
 SYN-ACK
 ACK  this 3 is called 3 way handshake.
 TLS handshake:TRansport layer security
 Virustotal
 Differnce b/w hashing and encryption
